# Rent a car Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite environment](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).

## Project Description

This rent a car app was created as final project for my Amplitudo Course. We where provided API endpoints(backend) from our mentor and our goal was to create app that has default admin of app that can add, edit, remove cars and also create, edit, delete reservations. Also it has users registration and users are limited only to view their past, current or future rentals.

## Project Features:

- Admin: Contains default admin that can add, edit, delete all 3 main groups of app - users, cars, rentals.
- Users: New users registration and limited acces to app - only view past, current and future reservations
- Basic app functions: Three groups (users, cars, rentals) with basic CRUD
- Login validation and input validation for users, cars, rentals

## Build with

- HTML
